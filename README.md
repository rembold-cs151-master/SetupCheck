# Setup Check!
---

If you are reading this you have presumably followed the guide (or the setup session) to get set up with Python and VSCode. Congrats! 

One of the first things you will usually want to do after accepting an assignment is to download the assignment materials to your local system. If you haven't yet, watch the section on downloading materials in the guide. To get some practice doing so, you should download the zip containing the contents of this page (in GitHub's parlance, we call this a repository). Download this zip file, and then unzip it to a known location.

Once you have the files locally, then next step will generally be to edit them in some way (or in this case, just run them). The easiest way to generally do this is to open VSCode, then from the File menu select "Open Folder", and select the _unzipped_ folder that you just made. You'll see all the contents of that folder then show up in the panel to the left. Selecting the `test_karel.py` file should pop it open to the right. Then, assuming you set everything up properly earlier, you should see a green play button in the upper right. Pressing that will run the program, which should pop open a Karel window in the middle of your screen. There is a big blue play button you can press there to make Karel follow the instructions it has been given.

You should ensure you have this working on your system _before_ you swing by my office hours. In addition to chatting with you about a few things, I will want to see evidence that you have this up and running (or we can fix it if something is awry).
